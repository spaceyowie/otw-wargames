-----[
-----[  LEVEL GOAL
-----[

The password for the next level is stored in a file called readme located in
the home directory. Use this password to log into bandit1 using SSH. Whenever
you find a password for a level, use SSH to log into that level and continue
the game.


-----[
-----[  SOLUTION
-----[

Level 1 continues on from the previous level so you should already be logged in
via SSH as the user `bandit0'.

The readme file (containing the password) can be read using the `cat' command.


[[  terminal ]]

bandit0@melinda:~$ ls
readme
bandit0@melinda:~$ cat readme

bandit0@melinda:~$ exit

[[  terminal ]]
