-----[
-----[  LEVEL GOAL
-----[

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of
the current level to port 30001 on localhost using SSL encryption.

Helpful note: Getting “HEARTBEATING” and “Read R BLOCK”? Use -quiet and read
the “CONNECTED COMMANDS” section in the manpage. Next to ‘R’ and ‘Q’, the ‘B’
command also works in this version of that command…

-----[  SOLUTION
-----[

Level 16 sounds similar to Level 15 but with the addition of requiring the
current password to be sent to an SSL-enabled server.

This challenge is in two parts again: first, use openssl to connect to port
30,001 on the localhost, and then pipe the current password from the file
/etc/bandit_pass/bandit15 to the SSL-enabled server at the end of the encrypted
connection.

Correct!
