[ Level 3        ]    https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit3.html


-----[
-----[  LEVEL GOAL
-----[

The password for the next level is stored in a file called `spaces in this
filename' located in the home directory.


-----[
-----[  SOLUTION
-----[

This level demonstrates another gotcha when working with files on the command
line: each space needs to be escaped by a `/' (backslash). This is applicable to
other special characters in a filename, too.


[[  terminal ]]

bandit2@melinda:~$ ls
spaces in this filename
bandit2@melinda:~$ cat spaces\ in\ this\ filename
UmHadQclWmgdLOKQ3YNgjWxGoRMb5luK
bandit2@melinda:~$ exit

[[ /terminal ]]
