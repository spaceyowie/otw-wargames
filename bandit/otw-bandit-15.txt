-----[
-----[  LEVEL GOAL
-----[

The password for the next level can be retrieved by submitting the password of
the current level to port 30000 on localhost.


-----[
-----[  SOLUTION
-----[

The password is in the file /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 (this was in Level 14's
description) and needs to be sent to port 30,000. This can be accomplished by
piping the password to netcat, which will need to have established a connection
to the mysterious service on port 30,000.


[[  terminal ]]

bandit14@melinda:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14

bandit14@melinda:~$ cat /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14 | nc localhost 30000
Correct!
