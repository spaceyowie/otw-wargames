[ Level 21       ]    https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit21.html


-----[
-----[  LEVEL GOAL
-----[

There is a setuid binary in the homedirectory that does the following: it makes
a connection to localhost on the port you specify as a commandline argument. It
then reads a line of text from the connection and compares it to the password in
the previous level (bandit20). If the password is correct, it will transmit the
password for the next level (bandit21).

NOTE: To beat this level, you need to login twice: once to run the setuid
command, and once to start a network daemon to which the setuid will connect.

NOTE 2: Try connecting to your own network daemon to see if it works as you think


-----[
-----[  SOLUTION
-----[

This level requires the use of two shells: one for nc to listen for the setuid
binary, the other to execute the setuid binary to connect to the port nc is
listening on.
