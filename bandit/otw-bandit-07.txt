[ Level 7        ]    https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/bandit7.html


-----[
-----[  LEVEL GOAL
-----[

The password for the next level is stored **somewhere on the server** and has
all of the following properties:
- owned by user bandit7
- owned by group bandit6
- 33 bytes in size


-----[
-----[  SOLUTION
-----[

Taking Level 6 one step further, the bingo for Level 7 is *somewhere* on the
box - again, the `find' command will be key to finding the file.
